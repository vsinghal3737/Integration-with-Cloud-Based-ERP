# Integration with Cloud-Based ERP

## Task Description
Develop an application to interact with a cloud-based ERP system (such as QuickBooks Online) by implementing authentication with QBO. The application should authenticate with the ERP's API, extract vendor and account data from the sandbox environment, and demonstrate updating a vendor record. The appearance of the user interface is irrelevant; it can be a simple command-line interface or any functional interface that fulfills the requirements.

As a part of this assignment, you will need to create a developer account with QBO. Visit [QBO Developer Sandboxes](https://developer.intuit.com/app/developer/qbo/docs/develop/sandboxes) for more details.

## Requirements

### Authentication with QBO
- Implement authentication with QuickBooks Online to securely authenticate with the ERP's API.
- Use appropriate authentication mechanisms provided by QBO's API.

### Data Extraction
- Retrieve sample vendor and account data from the sandbox environment of QuickBooks Online.
- Extract relevant data entities including vendor information (such as name, contact details) and account details.

### Data Update
- Implement functionality to update a vendor record in QuickBooks Online.
- Demonstrate updating at least one attribute of a vendor record (e.g., contact information).

### Error Handling
- Implement error handling mechanisms to handle API errors, authentication failures, or other unexpected issues.
- Provide informative error messages to aid in troubleshooting and debugging.

### Documentation
- Provide documentation with setup instructions, usage guidelines, and any additional notes.

## Additional Notes
- Integrate with a cloud-based ERP system.
- OAuth2 principles, API interaction, and error handling.
